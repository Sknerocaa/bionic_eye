<h2>How does a bionic eye work?</h2>
<!-- I have added a line break here as the word 'images' was coming with the image and was making the webpage look bad 
 and this section describes the working of a eye and how it is similar to a normal eye-->
<i><b>
first we would need to implant a micro processor inside the persons brain or eye retina and then 
process starts, The person would have to wear goggles which would capture what ever is infront of them
and then send those images to the implant which is present inside us, that would convert those images 
into pulses and those 
signal pulses would be sent into the brain and those signals into the brain and then brain reads those signal
and converts them into images<br>.
